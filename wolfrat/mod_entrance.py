"""A little fanfare when one of the server's moderators joins.

Pure decision logic, kept free of Qt (same idea as vote_rules.py): the tab
feeds in the player list every time it refreshes, and gets back the entrances
that are due - a chat line and whether to crack the lightning.

The rules, in the order they matter:

* Only names on the Mods list get an entrance, and only when the feature is on.
* A moderator must have been on the list for `delay_seconds` before anything
  is announced - they are still on the loading screen when their name first
  appears, and the thunder is for them as much as for everyone else.
* One entrance per moderator per `cooldown_minutes`. A shaky connection that
  drops and rejoins five times gets one fanfare, not five. The cooldown is
  remembered on disk by the caller (`ModEntrance.last_announced`), so
  restarting WolfRAT does not re-arm it.
* A map change is not a join. The admin connection drops during a map load and
  the player list comes back empty, then refills; `note_disconnected()` tells
  us the list cannot be trusted, and anybody who was present before the gap is
  treated as still present when the list returns.
* A moderator who leaves before the delay is up gets nothing (and keeps their
  cooldown unspent).
