"""Advance-and-Secure zones, no Qt (2026-09-22).

The server keeps every AAS zone in ``g_zone_slot_chain`` (jo_players reads
it): each zone has a tier (its order along the chain, 1..N) and an owning
team (0 nobody, 1 Joint Ops, 2 Rebels).  Capture messages never reach the
admin port - they are HUD events - so this is the only way to see them.

Two things come out of it:
* ``zones_left`` - how many zones the leading team still needs.  One left =
  the map is about to end, which is when the AAS map vote should start.
* ``ZoneWatch`` - the first capture of a map, for the Sprees tab.
