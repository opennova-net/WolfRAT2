"""Automatic team balance during the round, with volunteers.

Dale's design (2026-09-23): when one team has 2+ more players, the server
warns 30 seconds ahead and asks for volunteers (``!1``).  When the time is up
WolfRAT moves the players the gap needs - picked at random from the
volunteers on the bigger team first, then at random from everyone else on it.
No exemptions: an owner who turns this on wants it automatic.

Joint Ops has its own balance (``AutoBalanceOnRecycle``) but it only runs as a
new map starts, never mid-round.  The panel offers one or the other.

Every line WolfRAT says fits the 62-character chat limit.
