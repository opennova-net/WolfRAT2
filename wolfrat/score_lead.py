"""Lead announcements for Capture the Flag, Flagball, Team Deathmatch and
Deathmatch (Dale, 2026-09-23).  No Qt.

Scores:
* CTF / Flagball - each team's captures, read from the server on this PC
  (jo_players.read_team_caps; proven live 2026-09-23).
* Team Deathmatch - each team's kills, summed from the admin-port player list.
* Deathmatch - each player's kills from the same list.

Rules (Dale): a tie is nobody's lead.  CTF / Flagball change slowly, so every
new leader is announced at once, plus the first flag / goal of the map.  In
TDM / DM the lead can swap every few seconds, so a new leader must hold it
for 30 seconds and there is at most one lead line a minute.  The first
reading after a map change is only remembered (it can still be the last
map's scores).  Every line fits JO's 62-character chat.
