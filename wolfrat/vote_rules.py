"""When should the end-of-match map vote start?

Pure decision logic for the Map Voting tab, kept free of Qt so every rule can
be replayed against whole simulated matches in tests.

The original rule - start the vote N minutes before the timer runs out - is
always evaluated first and is never changed by anything in here. The extra
rules exist because some game modes end on a score, not on the clock: a team
deathmatch that reaches its kill limit at minute 25 of 40 never gets to
"3 minutes before the end", so no vote ever starts. Every extra rule is off
until an admin switches it on.
